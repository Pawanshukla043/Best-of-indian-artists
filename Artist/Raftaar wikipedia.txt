Raftaar became known after releasing his song "Swag Mera Desi" in 2013 with Manj Musik. The line "Ab yeh karke dikhao" from the song was a diss to Yo Yo Honey Singh.[clarify][3] "Ab yeh karke dikhao" was already used in Yo Yo Honey Singh's song "Party With The Bhoothnath" which led to a dispute between the two rappers in media.[4] "Swag Mera Desi" won Best Urban Song at the Brit Asia TV Music Awards in 2014.[5]
